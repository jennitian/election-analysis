# Election Analysis

## Overview
I was tasked with completing an analysis of election data from a local Colorado election.
There were several components to this project.
1. Tallying the total number of votes cast.
2. Listing the candidates on the ballots.
3. Calculating the number of votes for each candidate.
4. Calculating the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determining a winner.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the winner of the local election was Diana DeGette who won 272892 votes which was 73.8% of the total votes cast.
